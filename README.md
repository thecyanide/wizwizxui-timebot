- In the cpanel host, click on the Select PHPVersion option and make sure to activate Soap in the extension section
- To use the NowPayment portal, the charge amount must be above 3.5 dollars because it cannot be paid below 3.5 dollars.
- Lokishhost or Linux server must be outside of Iran (because Telegram is filtered in Iran)
- If you use the Trojan protocol, the panel must have the ability to create a Trojan, otherwise your panel will have problems.
- The validity of the config notification becomes zero after 2 days (that is, if the service is extended, the notification of expiration will be activated again)
- If the volume of the service reaches one gig and the time reaches one day, a notification will be sent to the user
- If the user does not renew the service within 48 hours, a service deletion notification will be sent to the user and the service will be deleted
- If the public message or notification is not sent when setting the cron job (when setting the cron job, just delete the domain address from inside the command)
- To create a test configuration, set the price to 0, each account can use the free test account only once
- Panel type (Senai and Alireza) is used for Sanai version 1.1.1 and above and Alireza version 0.4.2
- The panel type (simple) is used for Sanai version 1.0.9 and below, Alireza 0.3.2 and below, Vexilo Chinese panel, Niduka
- To use HTTP and Header in the robot, you must set the value of Header Type to http and enter the value of Host:domain.ir for the request header.
- To prevent the sale of a server, you can set the server balance to 0
- To set the income notification channel, click on the ID inside the glass keyboard and set the channel again
- To reinstall the robot, you must download the files from the beginning (the previous files do not work because you have a new file named baseinfo.php)



<br>

## Robot Settings


#### To register the server, observe the following points:

- Use a port that is open on the host, if you are not sure, send a ticket to the hosting support and ask for open ports on the server, usually port 8080 is open on most hosts.
- If your panel has a domain, the ssl of the panel must be active and start it with https
- If your panel has an IP address, please delete the two boxes in the settings of the panel according to the image below and save and restart the panel, and to register the server in the robot, you must enter it as http


<a align="center">
     <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27927279/228873312-7ac5f12a-5d67-465f-a106-45a11f8f82ee.PNG" />
</a>


<br>

#### Setting Protocol and Network:


Pay attention, if you set the tls-xtls settings like this, you must create this protocol and network when registering the plan.



- vless `ws - tcp ( tls - xtls )`
- vmess `ws - tcp ( tls - xtls )`
- vless `Grpc ( tls )`
- vmess `Grpc ( tls )`
- trojan `tcp ( xtls )`





#### When adding a server to the bot, please enter the following address




````
https://youdomain.com:54321
````

````
http://192.180.125:54321
````

````
https://youdomain.com:54321/path
````

#### The following address is wrong

````
https://youdomain.com:54321/xui/inbounds
````

````
https://youdomain.com:54321/
````


<br>

#### Setting the certificate inside the robot


- tls: `{"serverName": "","certificates": [{"certificateFile": "","keyFile": ""}]}`


- xtls: `{"serverName": "","certificates": [{"certificateFile": "","keyFile": ""}],"alpn": []}`

Example:

- Important note: do not leave a space between the ssl address and it should be without space, otherwise the entire x-ui panel will fail.

- serverName: yourdomain.com
- certificateFile: /root/cert.crt
- keyFile: /root/private.key


````
{"serverName": "yourdomain.com","certificates": [{"certificateFile": "/root/cert.crt","keyFile": "/root/private.key"}]}
````

````
{"serverName": "yourdomain.com","certificates": [{"certificateFile": "/root/cert.crt","keyFile": "/root/private.key"}],"alpn": [ ]}
````

<br>


## Shared Port


- With one output, you can receive as many configs as you want on different domains (subscribe for different operators)
- In order to use a special or shared port, first manually create a configuration with a specific port and in the shared plan of the robot, give the id of the configuration line to the robot so that it will automatically create the configurations on the port.


<br>

## Fixed Panel Error

- If you encounter such an error, please do the following carefully


<br>


<p align="center">
     <a>
         <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27927279/228843013-e06c3655-1fc9-44aa-a256-30d0d4a9a784.jpg" />
     </a>
</p>


<br>

- First, download the Navicat software or DB Browser for SQLite (you have to crack the Navicat software, but it has a nice user interface)
- Download the x-ui panel database file, which is in x-ui.db format, from the server which is in the path etc/x-ui/x-ui.db
- Enter the x-ui.db database file into the desired software, then delete the last configuration and save the project
- Upload the new file to the server and restart the panel once, the problem will be solved


<br>
